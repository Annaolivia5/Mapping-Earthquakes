# leaflet-challenge

In this project,
data from [the USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) for all earthquakes in the past day were used to create a map using Leaflet. The maps shows circle markers for each earthquake, based on their longitude and latitude. The markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color.
